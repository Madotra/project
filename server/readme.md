## This is The server Section

### First we create a react application with the command in the server folder:

***
npm init -y
***

this command is placed in the server folder in the project document.
As this project will have two section first we will have work on server section to create the backbone of the project.

Since my project is in a different  folder  iam just installing all the dependencies all at once using the code
***
npm install
***

I will be following the  functionality of the routes and controllers and modules as it was the best way i understood. rest was too complex for me understand.

We are using quit a few dependencies
1. cors
2. dotenv
3. express
4. mongoose
5. nodemon


### Now we will do the nex process of Authentication

To Add the functionality of Authentication we need to install two dependencies

1. bcrypts
2. jsonwebtoken

to install this Dependencies we will run the command

***
 npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
***
